PRIVACY POLICY AGREEMENT

This Privacy Policy Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into between OmgRod ("Bot Owner") and the user ("User") of the Omega Bot Discord bot (the "Bot").

By using the Bot, the User agrees to the terms of this Agreement. If the User does not agree, they should immediately discontinue use of the Bot.

1. Data Collection: The Bot Owner does not collect, store, or process personal user data. However, Omega Bot interacts with third-party services, including Ollama, which may process data independently. Users are encouraged to review Ollama’s privacy policy for further details.

2. Database Access: The Bot Owner has access to the database used to support the Bot's functionality. However, any important or private information stored is encrypted to ensure user privacy and security.

3. Use of Data: The Bot itself does not analyze, store, sell, or share any personal user data. Any information processed is strictly used to provide and enhance the Bot’s functionality.

4. Third-Party Services: While the Bot does not collect user data, it may rely on third-party services (such as Ollama) for certain features. These services operate independently and may have their own data processing policies. The Bot Owner does not control or take responsibility for how third-party services handle user data.

5. Security Measures: While the Bot Owner takes reasonable precautions to safeguard data, users should be aware that no system is completely secure. The encryption of sensitive data is implemented to reduce risk.

6. User Responsibilities: Users should avoid sharing personal or sensitive information when interacting with the Bot. The Bot Owner is not responsible for any information voluntarily provided by users in public or private channels.

7. Changes to the Policy: The Bot Owner may modify this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. Continued use of the Bot after any modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

8. Governing Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom. Any disputes arising under or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved in accordance with applicable laws and courts in the United Kingdom.

9. Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire privacy policy between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, whether written or oral, relating to the Bot’s data handling.

By using the Bot, the User acknowledges that they have read this Agreement, understand it, and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions.
